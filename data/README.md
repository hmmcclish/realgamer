# Data

## To start working

1. run in this dir: `yarn`
2. run in parent dir: `yarn`
3. generate all json data files: `yarn start`

## Notes

* `csv` files must use `tab` as separator
* Data cleaning should be done in `csv` files unless too much manual work is required
* Do not chante `csv` structure without changing the script
